          <span>
            Thank you for visiting this website (this “Site”), which is owned
            and operated by Neighborly (“Neighborly,” “we,” “us,” and “our”).
          </span>
          <h2>Scope of This Policy</h2>
          <span>
            This online privacy policy (this “Policy”) applies only to
            information collected through Neighborly-Owned websites on which it
            is posted. It does not apply to third-party platforms, such as
            websites owned by our franchisees, social media websites, vendor
            pages, websites of other corporations, limited liability companies,
            etc. or to Neighborly-owned websites or other Neighborly owned
            platforms on which it is not posted. It also does not apply to
            information collected through other channels, such as over the phone
            or in person.
          </span>
          <span>
            By installing any third-party application, you are authorizing such
            third-party application to perform the actions and/or share with the
            third-party application the information communicated to Neighborly,
            or requested from Neighborly to perform the actions and/or share
            with the third-party application the information communicated to
            Neighborly, or requested from Neighborly. Neighborly is going to
            send that information through the third-party application, which
            will then go through the internet. Neighborly shall not be held
            responsible for any dissemination, use, misuse, and/or disclosure of
            the user's information through use of this or any third-party
            application.

            Some of the information we collect through this Site may be
            “personal information”—information that identifies you personally,
            alone or in combination with other information available to us.
            Other information may be non-personally identifiable, such as
            information collected by cookies.
          </span>
          <span>
            This Policy may be supplemented or amended from time to time by
            additional privacy notices (“Privacy Notices”), provided at the time
            we collect your information. For example, certain pages of this Site
            may contain Privacy Notices providing more details about the
            information we collect on those particular pages, why we need that
            information, and choices you may have about the ways we use that
            information. In other cases, specific Privacy Notices may be
            required to comply with the privacy laws of one of the countries,
            provinces, or states in which we do business.
          </span>
          <h2>Your Consent</h2>
          <span>
            In General. We respect your right to make choices about the ways we
            collect, use, and disclose your information. This Policy describes
            some of your choices, such as your choice to opt out of receiving
            “cookies.” We may ask you to indicate your choices at the time and
            on the page where you provide your information.
          </span>
          <h2>This Policy May Change</h2>
          <span>
            Neighborly reserves the right to update or modify this Policy and
            any Privacy Notice, at any time and without prior notice, by posting
            the revised version of the Policy or Privacy Notice on this Site.
            These changes will only apply to the information we collect after we
            have posted the revised Policy or Privacy Notice on this Site.
          </span>
          <span>
            Your use of this Site following any such change constitutes your
            agreement that all information collected from or about you after the
            revised Policy is posted will be subject to the terms of the revised
            Policy. You may access the current version of this Policy at any
            time by clicking on the link marked “Privacy” at the bottom of each

            information you provide when you request service, express interest

            Information from Third-Party Social Media Platforms. You may be able

            information you previously provided to a third-party social media
            platform (such as Facebook or Twitter). By doing this, you are
            asking the third-party platform to send us information, including
            personal information, from your profile on that platform. We treat
            that information as we do any other information you give to us when
            you register, log on, or enhance your profile.

            identify you.
